# Probably gonna switch from spawning DNPC at start to encounter spawning. SNPC stay the same. (less to compute, easier to handle)
1. Split routine into navigation module and routine module. Premade paths for now.
1.1 Make work class into Resource: BaseWork -> custom works from there
1.2 Give routine stamina. Decrease on work, increase on rest at home \ sppoint
2. Work on single DNPC movement -> NPC intersection. Think about 2+ NPCs \ 2 NPC + player handling.
3. After NPC intersection maybe do NPC-to-NPC interaction.
4. Make home scenes, keep them active on town active, out of screen.
5. Keep track of performance \ resource usage.
